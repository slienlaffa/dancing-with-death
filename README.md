● The system should not allow to book more than 1 appointment for the same hour.
● The schedule must be set for office hours (9 am to 6 pm Monday to Friday) all year long
● Death is very picky with its agenda, so every appointment must contain date, start time and contact information (like e-mail).
● You can only appointment of 1 hour long with Death, more would be traumatic. Less would be too pointless.
